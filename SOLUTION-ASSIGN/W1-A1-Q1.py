"""
1) a > 5 and b >= 10
a is 5, which is not greater than 5. So, the first part (a > 5) is False.
b is 10, which is equal to 10. So, the second part (b >= 10) is True.
The overall expression is False (False and True).

2) a >= 5 or not b > 10
a is 5, which is equal to 5. So, the first part (a >= 5) is True.
b is 10, which is greater than 10. So, the second part (not b > 10) is True.
The overall expression is True (True or True).

3) not ( a > 5 and b > 5)
a is 5, which is not greater than 5. So, the first part (a > 5) is False.
b is 10, which is greater than 5. So, the second part (b > 5) is True.
The expression inside the parentheses is False (False and True), and the not negates it, resulting in True.

4) not ( a < 10 or not b < 10)
a is 5, which is less than 10. So, the first part (a < 10) is True.
b is 10, which is not less than 10. So, the second part (not b < 10) is False.
The expression inside the parentheses is True (True or False), and the not negates it, resulting in False.

5) not ( not a <= 5 or not b >= 10)
a is 5, which is equal to 5. So, the first part (not a <= 5) is False.
b is 10, which is greater than 10. So, the second part (not b >= 10) is False.
The expression inside the parentheses is False (False or False), and the not negates it, resulting in True.
